## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project simulates a basic **social network recommendation system**.  
It includes features like:
- **Friend Suggestions** ("People You May Know")
- **Page Suggestions** ("Pages You Might Like")
- **Data Cleaning** (removing duplicates, missing data, and inactive users)

By analyzing mutual friends and shared interests, the system intelligently recommends new connections and pages to users.
